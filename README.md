# Compiler_C_Flex_Bison

Academic project done for my third year at the INSA de Lyon. The idea was to create a compiler for the LOGO langage, to understand him and finally produce the corresponding drawing. Here is an example of this langage to draw a flower: 
REPEAT 8 [LEFT 45 REPEAT 6 [REPEAT 90 [FORWARD RED 1 LEFT 2] LEFT 90]]

Please read the README.txt for more informations.
